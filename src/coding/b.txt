[Verse 1]
The scenery doesn’t change; on a faded afternoon
I’m lying in the deep indigo beneath the overpass
I hear a single clap for my blank-page life
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

[Verse 2]
So things wouldn’t change
I wrote a story starring you in my notebook
My gas and water being cut off, society, and the news are all someone else’s problem
Look, my life is like ink

[Refrain]
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date as I get oldеr

[Chorus]
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds
As usual, they flow through my field of vision
In thе distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam
So many that it could be mistaken for spring
As if I’d just lost sight of you

[Verse 3]
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip
Life is made of nothing but compromises
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value
See pop shows near West Hollywood
Get tickets as low as $88

That’s Why I Gave Up On Music
Rachie
[Refrain]
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, and now I’m lying here waiting for its expiration date

[Chorus]
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw
An imagined, distant vision of you
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night
One more is in my eye

[Bridge]
Life is just one compromise after another
I learned that pretty fast
Elma, it’s you
You alone are my music

There are only eighty more characters in this song
Because maybe the only value of a life is in they way it ends

[Chorus]
I just, I just picture you
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam
Deep indigo covers my eyes

[Outro]
It’s just, it’s just…
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off
As if you were just swimming in the night
